Program Description:

This program, when built from translator.lex and translator.yacc, reads an input file (input.txt) containing modified Tiny-BASIC and outputs valid C code.
The input file should contain valid commands separated by the '\n' character. Linux and most windows text editors add this character when the enter key is pressed. Any whitespace will be ignored.

The modified Tiny-BASIC language is as follows:

program ::= block

block ::= block line | 
		line

line ::= INTEGER statement CR | 
		statement CR

statement ::= PRINT expr-list |
              	IF expression relop expression THEN statement |
              	GOTO expression |
              	INPUT var-list |
              	LET var = expression |
              	GOTO expression |
              	END

expr-list ::= expr-list , expression | 
		expression

var-list ::= var-list , var | 
		var

expression ::= expression + term |
		expression - term |
		term

term ::= term * factor |
		term / factor |
		factor

factor ::= var | 
	number | 
	(expression)

number ::= INTEGER | DECIMAL

var ::= A | B | C .... | Y | Z

relop ::= < | <= | > | >= | == | !=


----------Software and Programs Used for Testing----------

	Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
	gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5) 5.4.0 20160609
	flex 2.6.0
	byacc 1.9 20140715
	VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Nov 24 2016 16:44:48)
	
----------To Build Lex/Yacc Files----------

	Run the build bash script using the command "./build.sh"

	Alternatively, run these commands. Yacc is run twice since lex depends on changes made to YYSTYPE in translator.yacc (line 24)
		"yacc -h translator.yacc"
		"flex translator.lex"
		"yacc -h translator.yacc"
		"gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o translator.out"

----------To Run Lex/Yacc Files----------
	
	To parse input from a text file, include a file "input.txt" in the same directory as the program
	If no file is present you can also manually type in code and recieve C code line by line

	Run the command "./translator.out"
	Generated C code will then be printed to the console. This code can be copied into any standard file and compiled normally

----------Files Included----------

	a.out - output generated when test.c is compiled
	build.sh - a bash script to automate creating Lex/Yacc parsing program
	input.txt - a file containing sample input that can be used to verify correct functioning of the program
	lex.yy.x - a precreated file generated by translator.lex
	Sample.png - a screenshot of the program being compiled and it's output
	Sample2.png - a screenshot of the program being compiled and it's output
	test.c - a precreated file containing output given when translator.out is ran
	translator.lex - contains Lex code
	translator.out - a precompiled version of the program built with translator.lex and translator.yacc
	translator.yacc - contains Yacc code
	y.tab.c - a precreated file generated by translator.yacc
	y.tab.h - a precreated file generated by translator.yacc

	Only translator.lex and translator.yacc are required, the rest exist to save time and act as proof of a working program. All included files have been tested to ensure correct operation
